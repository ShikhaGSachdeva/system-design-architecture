DoS : Denial of Service

Main Algorithms:
Token bucket based Rate limiter (user in Amazon) - Token are added in regular internvals
Leaky bucket 
Fixed window - Request in a particular time (2 requests in 1 second allowed)
Sliding Window - 
Sliding Window Counter (
Most used Rate limiter algorithm:
the "sliding window" algorithm is generally considered the most adaptable, as it dynamically adjusts to changing traffic patterns by continuously updating a time window, allowing for more fluid control compared to fixed window approaches. 
Dynamic nature:
Unlike fixed window algorithms, the sliding window constantly shifts its time frame, allowing it to react to fluctuations in request rates. 
Smoothing out bursts:
By considering recent requests within the sliding window, the algorithm can handle sudden traffic surges without completely blocking users. 


How to mitigate DoS attacks on rate limiters:
Robust algorithm selection:
Choose a rate limiting algorithm that is resilient to burst traffic and can handle sudden spikes in requests, like the "sliding window" technique. 
Distributed implementation:
Deploy rate limiting across multiple servers to prevent a single point of failure and distribute the load. 
IP blocking:
Implement mechanisms to block malicious IP addresses that are identified as actively attempting DoS attacks. 
Adaptive rate limiting:
Utilize dynamic rate limiting based on real-time traffic patterns to adjust limits based on changing conditions. 
Monitoring and alerting:
Continuously monitor the rate limiter for suspicious activity and set up alerts to detect potential DoS attempts.
